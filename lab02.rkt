; Questions / missing ops
; 1. LIKEOP + NOT LIKEOP missing
; 2. How to denote COUNT(*): change to counting any non-null column (assuming no NaNs)
; 3. How to rename columns in select (e.g. SELECT col as colname): use AS on the outside
; 4. How to denote SELECT *: hardcode replace with all columns of table
; 5. ORDER-BY missing: test before ORDERING
; 6. LIMIT missing: test before LIMIT
; 7. Am I doing renaming using AS correctly? See q1d, q2b, q2c.
    ; When parsing student queries, override renaming of inner query. 
    ; This applies to all queries that are renamed
